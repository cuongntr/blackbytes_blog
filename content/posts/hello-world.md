## Welcome to BackBytes!

This is the inaugural post of **BackBytes** — my personal blog where I share thoughts, learnings, and experiments in software engineering and technology.

### What to expect

- Deep dives into software architecture and design
- Hands-on tutorials and how-to guides
- Reflections on the craft of software engineering
- Explorations of new tools and technologies

### Why "BackBytes"?

Every byte of code we write tells a story. This blog is about looking back at those bytes — understanding what we built, why we built it, and how we can do it better.

Stay tuned for more posts. Happy reading! 🚀
